BMAD assets placeholder.

The BMAD repository currently ships an installer (`npx bmad-method install`) that creates `_bmad/` and
`.claude/` integration files. This placeholder exists to match the plan's `.bmad-core/` expectation.

If you want the official BMAD files:
1) Ensure Node.js 20+ is installed.
2) From the project root, run: npx bmad-method install
